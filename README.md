This repository contains the code of first light weight full stack application that I built in the fall of 2022 through my Oregon state University Class on web development.

 I built a restful API with full CRUD functionality with Express js to interact with documents stored on my MongoDb database. 
 
 through this project I tried to keep accessability in mind with a simple and straight forward html layout that includes dynamically expanding links, and input fields so that readers with vision or motor impairments might have an easier time navigating the site. If you have questions, feel free to contact me via the info below.

 I enjoyed the opportunity to try my hand at designing a site to be visually pleasing.

 I hope you like my work!
